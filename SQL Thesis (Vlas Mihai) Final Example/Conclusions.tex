Views in SQL are a powerful tool that can simplify the work of the database architect or developer. By combining multiple tables in one view, easily updating and deleting some rows is facilitating the work and makes it a lot easier than using typical update and insert commands directly in the table of work. Views are statements with a name associated to it and stored in the database, this allows an easy creation and drop of the view in any moment of work. Depending on the type of view we need to use, the specific attributes should be modified in views. Views are virtual tables that facilitate the work for an IT person using a simpler way to give information and it can be used in different ways. From my opinion, views has 3 main functions, to reduce the complexity of the database schema, to implement higher row and column levels of security and to present aggregated data and hide detailed data.
The way how easy it is to create, update or delete a view we can exclaim that it is a tool that should be used more often and implemented on different databases.
