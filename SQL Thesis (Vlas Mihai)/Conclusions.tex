Views in SQL are a powerful tool that can simplify the work of the database architect or developer. By combining multiple tables in one view, easily updating and deleting some rows is facilitating the work and makes it a lor easier than using typical update and insert commands directly in the table of work. Views are statements with a name associated to it and stored in the database, this allows an easy creation and drop of the view in any moment of work. Depending on the type of view we need to use, the specific attributes should be modified in vews.
